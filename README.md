# Recycling App

The aim of the project was following the steps from design studio techniques and implementing a hi-fi prototype of an application.
We chose creating a prototype for a recycling application (3 people group project).
For our task, we had to complete the following design stages:
- User research - analysing the collected data and identifying the key problems (to be solved) of our future design.
- Creating scenarios related to those problems, sketches of the main ideas and mockups of the future solutions.
- Designing the lo-fi prototype (covering the previous scenarios) and evaluating it on different users.
- Designing the hi-fi prototype (covering the previous scenarios) and evaluating it on different users.
